### JavaScript Learning Guide for beginners -2021

Hey Everyone! I have been learning Javascript for quite a time now and the more I dig into it, the more it surprises me. So I created this repository for people 
who are new to the language. Its a great language in my opinion. Here are the details.

#### 👉🏻 [IMP] This is not your guide to begin programming but more of a transitioning to JS after knowing the fundamentals of programming.

### Salient Features
- The repository has been divided into 4 sections: -basics
                                                   -intermediate
                                                   -intermediate 2
                                                   -advanced
  These folders are based on the level of stuff in them.
- The code files have the output written along side the code itself, so you can use this as a reference for stuff like syntax.
- I used emojis as well 😂

### Feedback

You are free to create a PR or issue with the code. I will see those adn merge them to the main branch if neccesary
